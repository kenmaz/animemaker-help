> Conducts UGC moderation, as is reasonable and consistent with the type of UGC hosted by the app;
We are monitoring all uploaded contents in the app 24/365 based on user reports and patrols. If we found objectionable contents or behavior, we provide appropriate actions to them.

> In the case of augmented reality (AR) apps, UGC moderation (including the in-app reporting system) must account for both objectionable AR UGC (e.g., a sexually explicit AR image) and sensitive AR anchoring location (e.g., AR content anchored to a restricted area, such as a military base, or a private property where AR anchoring may cause issues for the property owner).
N/A

> Provides an in-app system for reporting objectionable UGC and users, and takes action against that UGC and/or user where appropriate;
> Provides an in-app system for blocking UGC and users;

We are providing in-app reporting / blocking system to all user content's page.
